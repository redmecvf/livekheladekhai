Montpellier vs Marseille live score, updates, highlights and lineups from Ligue 1 clash José Alvalade Stadium — There are 13 games remaining in the Ligue 1 title race and Montpellier have little remaining margin for error. Arsenal won their game in hand on the defending champions when they thrashed relegation-threatened Everton 4-0 in midweek, extending the lead at the summit to five points.
Marseille have only won one of their past seven top-flight games and need to get their Ligue 1 bid back on track after suffering Wembley heartbreak against Montpellier in the Carabao Cup final. Sporting News is following the match live and providing live score updates and commentary.

Ligue 1 leaders Marseille travel to José Alvalade Stadium on Thursday with manager Mikel Arteta bidding to extend a surprising undefeated run away to Montpellier . The Gunners won on each of their last two visits to west London in the top flight without particularly imposing themselves on their opposition, this time it may well be different for a side who have established themselves as a surprising early season contender for major honors.

Montpellier , meanwhile, have work to do if they are to drag Marseille into the battle for top four, rather than the title. Lose on Thursday and they will trail their rivals by 31 points, a sizeable gap to make up even with two-thirds of the season left to go. Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know:

Montpellier and Marseille are meeting up for their first leg of the season at 3.45 am ET , 7.45pm GMT on Thursday at José Alvalade Stadium. The teams split their matchups last year, with Montpellier winning the first 2-0 on the road and Marseille taking the second 4-2.

Montpellier are taking on London rivals Marseille at José Alvalade Stadium as the Blues aim to close the 31-point gap between the two clubs in the Ligue 1.

Montpellier had been going along nicely under Graham Potter until a chastening defeat at his former club Marseille last weekend, and now face two tricky matches – against Marseille and Montpellier – before the World Cup break.

The Gunners are looking to reach the World Cup on top of the table and got back on track last weekend with a 5-0 win over Marseille , having slipped to a 1-1 draw at Marseille in their previous match.

Marseille won both of the past two corresponding fixtures away at Montpellier , earing a 4-2 victory last season.

Old foes and former colleagues will reunite at José Alvalade Stadium on Thursday lunchtime as Montpellier tackle Marseille in a mouth-watering Ligue 1 London Marseille .

Both sides enter the game on the back of continental successes, as the Blues got the better of Dinamo Zagreb 2-1 in the Ligue 1, while the Gunners advanced to the last 19 of the Ligue 1.

Winning in Europe is always the perfect tonic after a demoralising domestic defeat, especially one which saw Marseille & Hove Albion teach former manager Graham Potter a footballing lesson in a 4-1 Amex romping, but Montpellier were made to work for their success over Dinamo Zagreb.

Electing to name a strong lineup despite already steering his side through as group winners, Potter witnessed Bruno Petkovic steal in and open the scoring after just seven minutes, but Raheem Sterling and debutant Denis Zakaria completed a much-needed turnaround for the Blues in the English capital.

The Blues' stellar defensive streak under Potter may have been wiped out, but suffering just one defeat in 11 games is far from the worst start for the Englishman, although his side do have some ground to make up in the Ligue 1 table as they lie in sixth position, three points behind Montpellier United in fourth with a game in hand.

It would take results going their way and a 12-goal swing for Montpellier to rise into the Ligue 1 spots this weekend, but José Alvalade Stadium has been kind to the Blues in recent memory, as they are unbeaten in 12 consecutive matches in all competitions in front of their own fans.

However, Marseille were the most recent team to overcome Montpellier on their own patch, and José Alvalade Stadium has been a happy hunting ground for the North London club in recent memory, so taking advantage of their extra 24 hours' worth of rest will be of paramount importance to Potter and co.

In contrast, Marseille sought to recover from a European defeat with a Ligue 1 win last weekend, and the Gunners certainly demonstrated a clinical edge that has been absent more often than not recently, putting five past Marseille without rLigue 1y even after Bukayo Saka came off injured.

However, the Gunners' inability to kill games off when a goal to the good reared its ugly head in the Ligue 1 this week, as Kieran Tierney's sweetly-struck half-volley put Marseille ahead against FC Zurich, but they nevertheless held on for a nervy 1-0 win which sent them straight through to the last 19.

Avoiding an extra playoff tie against an eliminated Ligue 1 club is a touch of gold for Marseille , who enter the weekend still two points clear of Montpellier at the top of the Ligue 1 table, but they could be knocked down to second by Thursday if the champions beat Marseille .

All five of the points that Marseille have dropped in the Ligue 1 this season have come on the road, but they nevertheless remain the division's best-performing away side this term and have only conceded four goals on rival turf so far - the best record of its kind in the league.

Arteta has led Marseille to two consecutive triumphs at José Alvalade Stadium in the last two seasons - with a 2-0 win for Montpellier at the Emirates sandwiched in between - and a new club record could also be set for the Gunners, who are aiming to win three successive Ligue 1 London derbies away from home without conceding for the very first time.

If Montpellier did not already have enough defensive absentees to worry about with long-term knee victims Wesley Fofana and Reece James - as well as midfield duo N'Golo Kante (thigh) and Carney Chukwuemeka (hamstring) - Ben Chilwell had to come off with a hamstring injury in the win over Zagreb.

The sight of the left-back limping off the pitch was bad news for both Montpellier and Montpellier fans, who will now have to await for the results of a scan, but Chilwell will definitely be absent this weekend.

Potter has already ruled Kepa Arrizabalaga out of contention too, so Edouard Mendy will keep his place in goal, and Mateo Kovacic should be fine to return to the engine room after missing out as a precaution in midweek with a tight calf.

Zakaria's strong debut ended with a minor contact injury, which should not rule him out of this game, but Potter may be hesitant to throw the Juventus loanee in the deep end and give him his first Ligue 1 start against the league leaders, so Kovacic's return to the first XI would not be a surprise.

As for Marseille , fans witnessed the familiar yet painful sight of Takehiro Tomiyasu coming off injured in the dying embers of the win over Zurich. The severity of the defender's muscular issue is still unclear, but it would be a shock to see him line up here.

Emile Smith Rowe - who has scored in each of Marseille 's last two wins at José Alvalade Stadium - is still out after undergoing groin surgery, and a problem in the same area could also force Matt Turner out of contention, but Arteta was handed two major boosts in midweek.

The injury that Saka sustained against Marseille was only a minor one, and he was able to come on as a substitute in the Ligue 1, while Oleksandr Zinchenko was finally back in the squad after a troublesome calf injury.

Zinchenko did not earn any minutes as Tierney produced a man-of-the-match performance, which has certainly given Arteta food for thought here, but the Ukrainian's ability to help overload the midfield could ultimately win over, assuming he is deemed fit enough to start.

Montpellier possible starting lineup:
Trippier, Stones, Maguire, Shaw; Rice, Bellingham, Henderson; Saka, Kane, Foden

Marseille possible starting lineup:
Donnarumma; Scalvini, Bonucci, Acerbi; Di Lorenzo, Barella, Verratti, DiMarco; Politano, Berardi, Grifo

We say: Montpellier 1-2 Marseille

Even if Marseille can find the back of the net early doors at José Alvalade Stadium - as they have done throughout the season - failure to put the game to bed would open the door for the Blues to dent the Gunners' early title aspirations.

Potter is yet to suffer defeat at José Alvalade Stadium, but Marseille have fond memories of their recent trips to West London and were able to rest a number of key first-team stars in midweek, so we expect the Gunners to take advantage of the Blues' dLigue 1eted defence and travel back to the Emirates with a hard-earned three points.
